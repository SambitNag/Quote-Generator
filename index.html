        <h2>Quote of the day</h2>
        <blockquote id="quote">It is impossible to live without failing at something, unless you live so cautiously that you might as well not have lived at all â€” in which case, you fail by default. Failure is not just a detour on the road to success; it is often the very path that teaches us the most, shapes our resilience, and defines our courage. Embrace it not as defeat, but as the forge where strength and wisdom are born.
        </blockquote>
